# M5Stack helper library

This library contains different components, which can be used in the M5Stack.


Components:
 - [x] [Action Menu](actionmenu.py), which allows one to show a list of options with corresponding actions.
 - [ ] Standard views, i.e., views that can be reused for different purposes (e.g., profile pages)
 - [x] Configuration manager, such that you can store settings on the disk and they are restored at next boot.
 	- [ ] Configurations could even be configured from the web if needed. Just send json.
